	<p>1. Don’t drink sugar calories
	Sugary drinks are among the most fattening items you can put into your body.

	This is because your brain doesn’t measure calories from liquid sugar the same way it does for solid food.

	Therefore, when you drink soda, you end up eating more total calories (.

	Sugary drinks are strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many other health problems
	Keep in mind that certain fruit juices may be almost as bad as soda in this regard, as they sometimes contain just as much sugar. Their small amounts of antioxidants do not negate the sugar’s harmful effects .</p>

	<p>2. Eat nuts
Despite being high in fat, nuts are incredibly nutritious and healthy.

They’re loaded with magnesium, vitamin E, fiber, and various other nutrients .

Studies demonstrate that nuts can help you lose weight and may help fight type 2 diabetes and heart disease .

<p>3. Avoid processed junk food (eat real food instead)
Processed junk food is incredibly unhealthy.

These foods have been engineered to trigger your pleasure centers, so they trick your brain into overeating — even promoting food addiction in some people.

They’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients but high in unhealthy ingredients like added sugar and refined grains. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.</p>

<p>4.Don’t fear coffee
Coffee is very healthy.

It’s high in antioxidants, and studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses .</p>

<p>5.Get enough sleep
The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated.

Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance  

What's more, poor sleep is one of the strongest individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. One study linked insufficient sleep to an 89% and 55% increased risk of obesity in children and adults, respectively .</p></h3>
