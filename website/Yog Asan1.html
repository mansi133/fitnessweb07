The word ‘Tada’ means mountain. To be able to get into other important standing poses like handstand or headstand, you need to first master the mountain pose. It may appear to be easy, but you need to perfect the technique that can actually transform your entire body and mind. It is usually one of the first poses taught in a yoga class.</p><p>Owing to our sedentary lifestyle, most of us may often experience a tight muscle or back pain due to sitting one pose through the day. Tadasana works to align your skeleton and brings it back to its neutral stance. It takes muscular effort to get into a pose which strengthens the core and weak backs.The Tadasana helps to create space within the body and allows the internal organs to work more efficiently, improves the respiratory system, digestive system and blood circulation. In addition, it improves concentration, increased strength for knees thighs and ankles, greater flexibility of the spine, relief from sciatica, as well as an overall increase in energy. The steady and concentrated posture of the pose can really help calm the mind.  Considering a lot of our guests are beginners at yoga, the Tadasana is the perfect pose to introduce them to the art of yoga,says Franny Chandra, Yoga Instructor at The Taj Mahal Hotel, New Delhi</p></justify></center></strong>");

Place your right foot high up on your left thigh. The sole of the foot should be flat and placed firmly. Keep your left leg straight and find your balance. While inhaling, raise your arms over your head and bring your palms together. Ensure that your spine is straight and take a few deep breaths. Slowly exhale, bring your hands down and release your right leg. Back in the standing position repeat the same with the other leg.</p></justify></center></strong>");
